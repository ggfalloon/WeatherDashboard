Type in any city you'd like to check the weather for and you'll be presented with the current weather conditions and a 5-Day Forecast.
In the current conditions, you'll find the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The color indicator for the UV Index is red for sever, yellow for moderate and green for favorable.
The 5-day forecast provides the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
Always be prepared with the Weather Dashboard!
